# Goals of this lab

The goal of this lab is get more practice with iterating through linked lists and solving problems. Continue to practice code tracing to reason about your code. We request that you DO NOT ask the staff to debug your code. They have been specifically instructed not to debug for you, rather to guide in the process.

This lab may be done solo, or in pairs.

Before you begin working on the lab, please decide if you will work solo or with a partner.

As stated in the previous lab, there are a few requirements you must follow if you decide to work with a partner. I will re-iterate them here:

* Your partner must be enrolled in the same lab section as you (so there is a dedicated time where you and your partner can work together).
* You and your partner must agree to work together outside of lab section in case you do not finish the lab during your lab section. You must agree to reserve at least two hours outside of lab section to work together if needed (preferrably during our TAs' office hours where you can ask them for additional help). You are responsible for exchanging contact information in case you need to reach your partner.
* If you choose to work with a partner for a future lab where pair programming is allowed, then you must choose a partner you have not worked with before.
* You MUST add your partner on Gradescope when submitting your work <strong>*<u>EACH TIME</u>*</strong> you submit a file(s). After uploading your file(s) on Gradescope, there is a "Group Members" link at the bottom (or "Add Group Member" under "Groups") where you can select the partner you are working with. Whoever uploaded the submission must make sure your partner is part of your Group. Click on "Group Members" -> "Add Member" and select your partner from the list.

Once you and your partner are in agreement, choose an initial driver and navigator.

# Step by Step Instructions

## Step 1: Getting Started

1. Go to github and create a git repo for this lab following the naming convention specified in previous labs. If you are working with a partner only one of you needs to create the repo.

4. If you are working with a partner and you are the one who created the github repo, add your partner as a collborator on the repo

5. Decide on initial navigator and driver.

6. Driver, log on to your CSIL account.

7. Open a terminal window and log into the correct machine.

8. Change into your CS 16 directory

Note: Remember to push your work to github at the end of EVERY work session. That way, both partners always have access to the latest version of the code even if the code is being developed on one partner's CoE account.

## Step 2: Obtaining the starter code

* Navigate to your cs16 directory and clone the git repository you created
```
git clone git@github.com:ucsb-cs16-m18/lab07_alily_jgaucho.git
```
* cd into this new directory
```
cd lab07_alily_jgaucho
```

* Copy the starter code by typing the following command:

```
cp /cs/faculty/richert/public_html/cs16/lab07/* ./
```

Typing the list (ls) command should show you the following files in your current directory

```
$ ls
linkedListFuncs.cpp  llTests.cpp              moreLinkedListFuncs.h  tddFuncs.h
linkedListFuncs.h    Makefile                 README.md
linkedList.h         moreLinkedListFuncs.cpp  tddFuncs.cpp
$ 
```

## Step 3: Reviewing the files and what your tasks are

Here is a list of your tasks for this lab:

### Step 3a: Familiarize yourself with the big picture

Type "make tests" and you will see some tests pass, but some fail.

You are finished when all the tests pass. We have implemented a few function that involve linked lists in `linkedListFuncs.cpp`. There is only one file you need to edit this week:

<code>moreLinkedListFuncs.cpp</code> contains more functions that deal with linked lists.  


### Step 3b: Work on the linked list functions

Working on the linked list functions below is one of the most important things you can do to prepare for the final exam.

There are 7 functions you will need to write for this lab:

* <code>addIntToEndOfList</code>
* <code>addIntToStartOfList</code>
* <code>pointerToMax</code>
* <code>pointerToMin</code>
* <code>largestValue</code>
* <code>smallestValue</code>
* <code>sum</code>


Each one has a set of tests which can be found under its corresponding heading when you type <code>make tests</code>. For example, the addIntToEndOfList tests look like this to start: 

```
./llTests 1
--------------ADD_INT_TO_END_OF_LIST--------------
PASSED: linkedListToString(list)
   FAILED: linkedListToString(list)
     Expected: [42]->[57]->[61]->[12]->null Actual: [42]->[57]->[61]->null
   FAILED: linkedListToString(list)
     Expected: [42]->[57]->[61]->[12]->[-17]->null Actual: [42]->[57]->[61]->null
PASSED: linkedListToString(empty)
   FAILED: linkedListToString(empty)
     Expected: [0]->null Actual: null
   FAILED: linkedListToString(empty)
     Expected: [0]->[19]->null Actual: null

```

You should replace each function stub with the correct code for the function until all of the tests for each one pass. It is recommended that you work on the functions one at a time in the order that they are presented above. That is, get all the tests to pass for addIntToStartOfList then addIntToEndOfList and so on. When all the tests pass, move on to the next step. 

## Step 4: Checking your work before submitting

When you are finished, you should be able to type  <code>make clean</code> and then <code>make tests</code> and see the following output:


```
-bash-4.2$ make clean
/bin/rm -f llTests *.o
-bash-4.2$ make tests
g++ -Wall -Wno-uninitialized   -c -o llTests.o llTests.cpp

-bash-4.2$
```

At that point, you are ready to try submitting on Gradescope.


## Step 5: Turn in your code on Gradescope

Submit all the .cpp and .h files to Lab06 assignment on Gradescope via your github repo. Then visit Gradescope and check that you have a correct score. If you are working with a partner, make sure both of you join a team on gradescope, otherwise only one of you will get credit for the lab

* You must check that you have followed these style guidelines:

1. Indentation is neat, consistent and follows good practice (see below)
2. Variable name choice: variables should have sensible names.
	More on indentation: Your code should be indented neatly. Code that is inside braces should be indented, and code that is at the same "level" of nesting inside braces should be indented in a consistent way. Follow the examples from lecture, the sample code, and from the textbook.   

* Your submission should be on-time. If you miss the deadline, you are subject to getting a zero.

Commit and push the latest version of your code on github

## An important word about academic honesty and the gradescope system

We will test your code against other data files too&mdash;not just these.  So while you might be able to pass the tests on gradescope now by just doing a hard-coded "cout" of the expected output, that will NOT receive credit.    

To be very clear, code like this will pass on gradescope, BUT REPRESENTS A FORM OF ACADEMIC DISHONESTY since it is an attempt to just "game the system", i.e. to get the tests to pass without really solving the problem.

I would hope this would be obvious, but I have to say it so that there is no ambiguity: hard coding your output is a form of cheating, i.e. a form of "academic dishonesty".  Submitting a program of this kind would be subject not only to a reduced grade, but to possible disciplinary penalties.    If there is <em>any</em> doubt about this fact, please ask your TA and/or your instructor for clarification.

## Logging out

If you are in the Phelps lab or in CSIL, make sure to log out of the machine before you leave. Also, make sure to close all open programs before you log out. Some programs will not work next time if they are not closed. Remember to save all your open files before you close your text editor.

If you are logged in remotely, you can log out using the exit command:

```
$ exit
```
