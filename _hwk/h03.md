<ol start="1">

<li>(10 pts) Fill in the information in the header. The following are required to get the 10 "participation" points.
    <ul>
    <li>Filling in your name and umail address.<br /></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    	<li>Also: For paper submission PLEASE submit on ONE SHEET OF PAPER, double-sided if at all possible. If you must submit on two printed sheets write name on BOTH sheets and no staples, paperclips, or folded corners.<br /></li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li>(3 pts) Precedence rules determine how the compiler groups operators and operands when evaluating an expression in the absence of parenthesis. For each of the following expressions add parenthesis to show how the expression is evaluated according to the C++ precedence rules?

<div markdown="1">
```
  a) x == 2 || y > 20

  b) !y && x < 9 * 2 || y < x

  c) x + 7 > 10 || x + 23 < -7
```
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>
</li>

<li> (2 pts) Show the output of the following code AND also write the final value of x after the code is executed.
<div markdown="1">
```
int x = 19;
while (x > 0) {
   cout << x << endl;
   x = x – 5;
}
```
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>
</li>

<li> (6 pts) What is the result (i.e. TRUE or FALSE) of the following Boolean expressions in C++, given that: x = 2, y = -1, z = 0 in each case?
  <div style="margin-bottom:0em"></div>
<div markdown="1">
```
  a) (x == 6)
  b) !(y > 0)
  c) ((x == 2) || (y > 20))
  d) ((x >= 3) && (z <= 12))
  e) ((x > y) && (y < z))
  f) ((!(x < z) || (y > z)) && (z == 12) && (y == 10))

```
</div>

<li> (2 pts) What is a runtime error in C++?
  <div style="margin-bottom:3em"></div>
 </li>

<div class="pagebreak"></div>

<li style="margin-bottom: 2em;" markdown="1"> (9 pts) What is the output of the following three (independent) segments of code?

```
int p = 5;
while (--p > 0)
     cout << p << " ";
```
------------------
```
int s = 1;
do
     cout << s << " ";
while (s++ <= 5);
```
------------------
```
int s = 1;
while (++s <= 5);
```
</li>

<li> (10 pts) Write a function named <code>check_increasing</code> that takes three arguments of type int and returns true if the arguments are in increasing order; otherwise, it returns false. You can use any type of C++ statements that we've gone over in class so far to accomplish this goal.
  <div style="margin-bottom:20em"></div>
</li>



<li> (8 pts) Using plain and/or multiway if-else statements ONLY, write a program that outputs the grade of a student given an integer variable 'score'. The program should read the student's score from standard input. If the score is outside the range of 0 and 100, the program should output "Not a valid score" and exit. Otherwise it should output the string "Grade is X" where X is replaced by the student's letter grade according to the following rubric:
<div markdown="1">
```
90 <= score <= 100, grade = 'A'| 80 <= score < 90, grade = 'B'| 70 <= score < 80, grade = 'C'|
60 <= score < 70, grade = 'D' | 0 <= score < 60, grade = 'F'
```

* Make your program easy to read and understand. Format your answers so that they are readable on the display. This means consider your use of "\n" characters. 
<div style="margin-bottom:0em"></div>
* Test this program out by compiling it and running it the same way you do with lab assignments. When you are sure that you have a working program, write it out in the space provided below. You will be graded for programming style as well as having a functionally correct program.
