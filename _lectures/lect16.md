- No book, no notes

Format
- Similar to midterms
- Possible types of questions
	- Short answers
		- Explain, describe, define, ...
	- Write some code
	- Fill in the blank
	- True / false, if false explain why
	- Given some code, write the output
- Should take ~ 1 hour, but you have the entire lecture to finish
- Covers a broad range of topics, but probably not everything.
